<h4>My Research</h4>

<p>My research seeks to answer fundamental questions about language change, including how we can distinguish between language change that arises from internal processes versus random drift, parallel developments or contact, and what theoretical implications this distinction has on our understanding of language evolution.
I am also interested in studying the historical trajectories of languages, with a particular focus on understanding how and why certain languages spread and others decline and the interdisciplinary reconstruction of the processes underlying shifts in linguistic distributions, such as population movements, changes in ways of life, developments of new technologies and genetic admixture.<br>
<p>
Currently, my research is focused on identifying the mechanisms that drive language change and how these mechanisms vary across different linguistic contexts. For example, how geographical, environmental or social factors influence language use and subsequently language structures.<br>

<h4>Project description</h4>

<p>Understanding how extra-linguistic factors influence language structures is key to
the study of language evolution. It is well recognised by now that many external
factors are responsible for the linguistic patterns we see today. However, we still
lack an in-depth understanding of the precise nature of the interaction between specific environmental and social aspects and language. This interdisciplinary project
tackles this issue by assembling a representative database that addresses the interaction between language structures and geographic, environmental and social
factors in a systematic way.</p>
<p> Specific geographic (isolation, roughness of the terrain, distance from the equator, distance to other societies), environmental (rainfall, mean growing season,
mean temperature, availability of resources) and social (size and density of the
group, social ties, political and family structures, contact with other groups) factors have been indicated in quantitative studies to correlate with language distri-
butions and linguistic diversity. Though a unifying theory of the mechanisms that
drive these correlations is still missing. Often, correlations found in one region
or circumstance do not hold for another.
<p>The aim of this project is to generate
hypotheses as to the way in which geographical, environmental and social factors
affect the way languages are distributed and change over time, and in particular,
on which aspect of the language they operate, by testing correlations to specific
components of the grammar. By identifying the specific grammatical structures affected by external factors, we will be able to better understand the operations that
drive change and to generate more concrete hypotheses as to what these processes
are.<p>

<h4>Project description</h4>

<p>The Ancient Near East is a cultural, political, and economical hotspot with over 5000 years of uninterrupted documentation of linguistic history. Up until the mid first millennium CE, various languages belonging to the Afro-Asiatic, Hurro-Urartian, and Indo-European language families are known to have coexisted with at least four language isolates contributing to the mixture.<br>
This unique configuration is an ideal testbed for tracing the distribution and spread of linguistic features within and across families and is of particular interest for estimating the impact language isolates can have on the typological profile of languages from larger families.</p>
<p>
The main aim of this dissertation is to put forward a substantiated claim about language variation and linguistic distributions which is supported by historical, archaeological, genetic, and sociolinguistic evidence. In particular, it puts forward the claim that linguistic distributions have changed significantly from pre-modern times and that the feature distributions seen today are not representative of all languages at all times.</p>

It has long been recognised that Sumerian and Hurrian, two languages spoken in the third millenium BCE in the Near East, diverge from that of the rest of the known ancient languages in the same area. We explore the proposition that the special typology of Sumerian and Hurrian reflects a distribution that predates the large agriculturally-driven language spreads in Eurasia. If this is the case, we expect enclave and isolate languages in Eurasia today to exhibit some similarities in their structural features to those found in Sumerian and Hurrian. We examine four possible features that may have had a broader distribution in antiquity than they do today: morphological optative, ergative alignment, high levels of verbal synthesis, and no gender distinction in independent personal pronouns. Each of these are characteristic of Sumerian and Hurrian but not other ancient languages of the Near East.

The distribution and diversity of languages harbor important evidence about general characteristics of human cognition and behavior. Yet it is debated to what extent the current frequency distributions of linguistic features inform us about what is representative of the language faculty and does not instead result from historical contingencies. We probe this question by leveraging unique data from the oldest attested languages, those preserved through writing from up to 5,000 years ago in the Ancient Near East. We examine 81 grammatical features for which there is sufficient evidence in the available records. After controlling for relatedness we find robust deviations of two of the oldest languages, Hurrian and Sumerian. The spatial and temporal placement of these reveal a divergent distribution of features in the greater region, suggesting massive transformations of the linguistic distributions in the past few millennia. This challenges inferences about general characteristics of language based on modern distributions.

This paper presents the first case of dramatic and large-scale loss of linguistic diversity. Language death has been part of our history as long as languages were spoken, but in the fourth millennium bce urbanisation and a growing regional economy caused a decrease in both language and typological diversity on a much larger scale than ever before. The first cities in Mesopotamia had developed writing and administration which centralised power and disseminated its influence. In particular, standard languages that were used for official purposes over large areas emerged. Written standard language slowed down the rate of change and consolidated diverging dialects. The larger areas in which languages were spoken in combination with increased mobility and long-distance contacts increased language contact and decreased typological differentiation. Massive population movements due to natural and human made disasters wiped out whole linguistic lineages through language shifts. In effect, this was a first wave globalisation, resulting in the first extensive linguistic diversity eradication.

Phylogenetic trees are a central tool for studying language evolution and have wide implications for understanding cultural evolution as a whole. For example, they have been the basis of studies on the evolution of musical instruments, religious beliefs and political complexity. Bayesian phylogenetic methods are transparent regarding the data and assumptions underlying the inference. One of these assumptions—that languages change independently—is incompatible with the reality of language evolution, particularly with language contact. When speakers interact, languages frequently borrow linguistic traits from each other. Phylogenetic methods ignore this issue, which can lead to errors in the reconstruction. More importantly, they neglect the rich history of language contact. A principled way of integrating language contact in phylogenetic methods is sorely missing. We present contacTrees, a Bayesian phylogenetic model with horizontal transfer for language evolution. The model efficiently infers the phylogenetic tree of a language family and contact events between its clades. The implementation is available as a package for the phylogenetics software BEAST 2. We apply contacTrees in a simulation study and a case study on a subset of well-documented Indo-European languages. The simulation study demonstrates that contacTrees correctly reconstructs the history of a simulated language family, including simulated contact events. Moreover, it shows that ignoring contact can lead to systematic errors in the estimated tree height, rate of change and tree topology, which can be avoided with contacTrees. The case study confirms that contacTrees reconstructs known contact events in the history of Indo-European and finds known loanwords, demonstrating its practical potential. The model has a higher statistical fit to the data than a conventional phylogenetic reconstruction, and the reconstructed tree height is significantly closer to well-attested estimates. Our method closes a long-standing gap between the theoretical and empirical models of cultural evolution. The implications are especially relevant for less documented language families, where our knowledge of past contacts and linguistic borrowings is limited. Since linguistic phylogenies have become the backbone of many studies of cultural evolution, the addition of this integral piece of the puzzle is crucial in the endeavour to understand the history of human culture.

<p>
This chapter adopts Mufwene’s (2001) framework according to which language acquisition is a process whereby competition and selection of linguistic features from the inputs create a unique idiolect. It examines the principles of selection of a given feature over others, and the mechanisms by which a feature spreads across a community (i.e., from one idiolect to another). These questions are addressed at the individual and population levels by analysing data from a twitter corpus. The frequency of a feature in the input as well as a suggested learnability factor are relevant to this discussion. Learnability is defined as the combination of the specific linguistic properties of a linguistic feature, and the universal human capacity to learn those specific properties.

This paper looks at the transparency features in Modern Hebrew. It takes a diachronic perspective and makes the prediction that due to immense language contact Modern Hebrew is becoming more transparent over time. The results are mixed, with some features showing increase in transparency over time, while others show the opposite process. Ultimately, the results are analyzed as an overall trend in which Modern Hebrew is becoming more transparent.
